                <span class="heading">How did we get here?</span><br>
                Many years ago, I stumbled upon a little cafe that served the Best Breakfast 
                Burritos EVER! It was short lived, as we ended up moving 2000 miles away. 
                I had no choice but to attempt to recreate them at home, I eventually created my 
                own verisons. Almost every weekend my kids, "Dad, We want breakfast burritos"! I eventually 
                introduced them to several close friends. From then on, whenever friends visit us from out of town, 
                I'm making my Breakfast Burritos. I continued to create new recipes and introducing them to more 
                friends and coworkers. I started getting common feedback, "I'll pay you if you make them for me".
                
                The overwhelming response combined with the fact I've always enjoyed working in the food 
                industry, The Dream was ignited. So I started creating our menu and designing our future 
                Food Trailer.
                
                One weekend after shopping for orders from co-workers, I got home and was really hungry. 
                I opened the fridge and there was a couple of left-over Grilled burgers from the night 
                before but we're out of buns. I thought, "Hmmmm, I have the ingredients and could easily
                make a bacon cheeseburger in a burrito". I was able to make a couple of burgerritos and 
                shared them with the kids.
                The Bacon Cheddar Burgerrito was born and Only the Beginning...
                Since that day, the creative juices have been flowing and many additional recipes have 
                been born and continue to be conceived. The Jamerrito, The Flamin' Jamaic'n, The Mambo 
                Italiano and The Nachorrito, just to name a few... The Family, in addition to a few 
                Special Friends, have become the official NOB's Taste Testers. If it doesn't pass them, 
                you won't see it on the menu.

                        the line, I can't express my Gratitude and Appreciation enough!

                <br>When thinking of a name for our business,
                many ideas were tossed around.
                One Really stuck, a little humor along
                with what we serve.
                So, what do we primarily serve?
                <span>Burritos</span>
                Big deal many food trucks serve burritos...
                But we serve Burritos that are unusual
                not the typical burrito, not ordinary.
                <span>Ordinary</span> 
                I Give You:
