                <br><br>

                Many years ago, I stumbled upon a little caf√© that served the best breakfast burritos ever! It was short-lived, 
                as we ended up moving 2,000 miles away. I had no choice but to attempt to recreate them at home, and eventually, 
                I created my own versions. Almost every weekend, my kids exclaimed, "Dad, we want breakfast burritos!"

                <br><br>

                Eventually, I introduced them to several close friends. From then on, whenever friends visited us from out of town, 
                I made my breakfast burritos. I continued to create new recipes and introduced them to more friends and coworkers. 
                I started getting common feedback like, "I'll pay you if you make them for me!" With the overwhelmingly positive 
                response - combined with the fact that I've always enjoyed working in the food industry - the dream was ignited. 
                So, I started creating our menu and designing our future food trailer.

                <br><br>

                One weekend, after shopping for orders from coworkers, I got home and was really hungry. I opened the fridge, 
                and there were a couple of grilled burgers from the night before! But... we're out of buns. I thought, 
                "Hmmmm... I have the ingredients and could easily make a bacon cheeseburger into a burrito." I then made a couple 
                of burgerritos and shared them with the kids! The Bacon Cheddar Burgerrito was born, and this was only the beginning...

                <br><br>

                Since that day, the creative juices have been flowing, and many additional recipes have been born (and continue to be)! 
                The Jamerrito, The Flamin' Jamaic'n, The Mambo Italiano, and The Nachorrito - just to name a few. The family, in addition 
                to a few special friends, has become the official NOB's Taste Testers. If it doesn't pass them, you won't see it on the menu.

                <br><br>
                
                The evolution of our food truck dream, a <i>much greater dream</i> was realized:
                
                <br><br>

                The creation of a program to promote <b>socialization and improve essential skills</b> (within a 
                reasonably controlled environment) for our young adult son with cerebral palsy and autism.

                <br><br>

                Ben will be taking your orders while socializing and interacting with you.

                <span id="coping-tech">*Please be kind as we develop his coping techniques!</span>

                Additionally, he will attain essential daily skills. Our long term goal is to generate future positions, 
                within, to support and encourage young adults with autism and other developmental disorders.

                <span class="heading">The Making of Our Name</span>

                <br><br>
                
                When thinking of a name for our business, many ideas were tossed around.
                One <i>really</i> stuck, with a little humor along the way.
                So, what do we primarily serve?
                <span>Burritos!</span>
                Big deal, many food trucks serve burritos...
                But we serve Burritos that are unusual - not the typical burrito, not ordinary.
                <span>Ordinary</span> 
                I give you:
                <span>N.O.B's</span>
                No Ordinary Burritos
                & more...
